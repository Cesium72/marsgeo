      <p>Mars is the fourth <span class="word">rocky planet</span> from our sun, and it is sometimes referred to as the "red planet" because of the rich amount of iron dust occupying most of its <span class="word">geosphere</span>. Scientists are wondering whether Mars could be, is, or was <span class="word">habitable</span>.</p>

          <h3>A rock found on Mars</h3>

      <p>
        The rock pictured above is a sedimentary rock, which can be determined from how it is very porous. Sedimentary rocks are formed by a <span class="word">geologic process</span> known as lithification. The sediments (dust) will sink to the bottom of a body of water before being compacted into rock. Then, minerals will fill the miniscule gaps between the individual grains of sediment to make it denser and harder. Because sedimentary rocks require liquid water in their creation, this means that Mars must have had liquid water on its surface at some point, meaning it has the potential to be suitable for life.

        The landscape pictured above is a black-and-white image of many <span class="word">landforms</span> on the Martian surface. The red splotch indicates the approximate location of the sedimentary rock from before, and the blue line outlines a potential <span class="word">channel</span> carved by previously flowing water. The water indicates a previous <span class="word">hydrosphere</span> on Mars - one of the necessary <span class="word">systems</span> to support life.<br/><br/>Water is still on the red planet, but all of it is frozen at the polar caps in the form of ice.

          <h3>The Martian atmosphere</h3>

      <p>
        Although Mars has water, it is lacking an <span class="word">atmosphere</span> necessary for life. At sea level, Earth's <span class="word">atmosphere</span> has a pressure of about 1 bar. In contrast, Mars has an <span class="word">atmospheric</span> pressure of 6.5 <i>millibars</i>. Mars has no ozone layer, and this means that harmful radiation from the Sun can leak in, which would pose a threat to any organism. However, we have sourced the destruction of the Martian <span class="word">atmosphere</span> to solar radiation over a long period of time. This means that Mars could have had a life-supporting <span class="word">atmosphere</span> at one point in time.

          <h3>Back to the big question</h3>
        </div>
        <hr/>
      </div><br/>
      <p>
        Mars might not be <span class="word">habitable</span> on its own right now, but it may have been in the past. There is evidence of <span class="word">systems</span> required to make a planet support life. Mars obviously has a <span class="word">geosphere</span> as anyone can see from looking at it, but there may have also been a <span class="word">hydrosphere</span> (liquid water) and an <span class="word">atmosphere</span> in the past. This means that there could have previously been life suited to survive on Mars, therefore meaning the red planet may have formerly had a <span class="word">biosphere</span>.<br/><br/>
          However, the more pressing question is whether humans could make Mars is habitable <i>now</i>. Humans could theoretically construct an artificial <span class="word">biosphere</span> with enough breathable air and protection from solar radiation (for the artificial <span class="word">atmosphere</span>), a contraption to melt and purify the frozen water at the polar caps (for the artificial <span class="word">hydrosphere</span>). The <span class="word">geosphere</span> is already there, and the temperature control would certainly be possible. Humanity is currently constrained by transportation and funding issues, but setting up camp on Mars would be the easy part (relative to everything else, it would still be quite a feat).
